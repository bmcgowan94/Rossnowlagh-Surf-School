# Rossnowlagh Surf School Website
The HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for the new Rossnowlagh Surf School Website. 

## Navbar
The navbar was created using flexbox, to neatly arrange the list items within it. This is done by setting the container div's display property to flex, and then setting the 'justify content' property to 'fex-end' to have the items sitting nicely on the right side of the nav. 
Using media queries, the navbar-toggle icon is set to appear when the viewport width is less than 665px wide.
