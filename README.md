The HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for the new Rossnowlagh Surf School Website. 

## Navbar
The navbar was created using flexbox, to neatly arrange the items within it. This is done by setting the container div's (main-nav) display property to flex, and then setting the 'justify content' property to 'fex-end' to have the items sitting on the right side of the nav.
